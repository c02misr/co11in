            <p>After struggling to answer the 'What do you do?' question since I quit my tech sales job in November 2023, I've settled on the term 'Entrepreneur' (although I'm solo right now and plan to be for the next few years). I'm working on multiple projects with the goal to make a suitable living from them. They're all tangentially related to my passions.</p>
